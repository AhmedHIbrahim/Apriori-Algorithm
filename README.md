# Apriori-Algorithm
In this Project, I have coded the Apriori Algorithm from scratch depending on its Pseudocode. 

# Introduction
The purpose of the coded Apriori Algorithm is to find the frequent itemset that passed a specific minimum support threshold. Finally, it will return the candidate itemsets and the frequent itemsets that were mined from them.

# What I learnt
1- Big O notation.
2- Java based Data Structers.
